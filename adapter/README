The Encrypter class uses a venerable encryption algorithm. To come up with the encrypted text, it computes the exclusive OR (sometimes known as XOR) of each character of the input text with the corresponding character of the key, repeating the key over and over as needed. The beauty of this algorithm is that it is its own inverse, so you can decrypt the text by simply running the encrypted text through—with the same key—a second time.
